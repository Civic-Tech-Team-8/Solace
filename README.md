# Solace

### Mission Statement

Solace strives to provide people with peace of mind and the reassurance that their loved ones are safe and secure back home after a natural disaster occurs.

### Who We Serve**

Our target audience are people in communities that have been impacted by natural disasters or that have family and/or friends in affected communities. Our program seeks to assist these communities in staying better connected to each other internationally and create a sense of security through communication in response to the increasing number of natural disasters occurring as a result of climate change.

### Product Overview

Our mobile-first web application, Solace, is designed to address the specific needs of communities that are at risk of a natural disaster occurring by connecting them with their loved ones and providing peace of mind regarding their family's safety and well-being. The app aims to facilitate seamless communication between families, particularly during times of crisis. Additionally, Solace offers a unique feature that allows users to stay informed about upcoming potential disasters worldwide. 

### Summary

Many people are unaware of the increase in natural disasters due to climate change and the specific hazards that their communities may face. Many do not have access to timely and accurate information about ongoing disasters and this can lead to a lack of preparedness and increased vulnerability to the effects of natural hazards. “Every year in the United States, natural hazards threaten lives and livelihoods and result in billions of dollars in damage.”(National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA))Knowledge about natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, and wildfires, helps people prepare and take appropriate actions to protect themselves, their families, and their property. Early warning systems, evacuation plans, and disaster preparedness measures can significantly reduce the loss of life and property during such events.

“Climate change is the defining issue of our time….every day we fail to act is a day that we step a little closer towards a fate that none of us wants- a fate that will resonate through generations in the damage done to humankind and life on earth.”(Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary General)

Additionally, during and after a disaster, people often experience anxiety and concern for the safety of their loved ones. “It's common for communities and individuals affected by a disaster to experience a range of thoughts, feelings and behaviours that can be intense, confusing and frightening.” (beyondblue.org) Communication channels can become disrupted or overloaded, making it difficult for individuals to reassure their family and friends that they are safe and secure.

The aftermath of a natural disaster leads to families being homeless, shortages of food and even a negative impact on the economy. This leaves the people impacted by the natural disasters vulnerable and in need of help with minimum support.

Solace provides users with a platform that enables them to navigate to a dedicated page showcasing various crisis events. 

### The Problem

The increasing frequency of natural disasters due to climate change poses a significant challenge to people who are impacted by the disaster. It becomes crucial for them to have a means of ensuring the safety and well-being of their friends and family during such events. 

There are numerous individuals who possess the desire to contribute their time and/or resources in assisting those impacted by natural disasters. However, they often face the challenge of not knowing the most effective ways to do so safely during natural disasters. 

This website would serve as a vital communication platform, bridging the gap and alleviating the concerns in times of crisis. Also allowing other users from all around the world to help the people affected by the disaster by donating goods or money or starting a group chat where other users of the same interests can join and go out to the location and physically help during the aftermath of the disaster.

### Solution

Our app aims to address these challenges by providing a centralized platform that offers comprehensive information on natural hazards, real-time updates, and alerts. By raising awareness, it helps users understand the risks in their communities and take appropriate measures to prepare for and respond to disasters. 

This application would serve as a vital communication platform, bridging the gap and alleviating the concerns of those in high risk areas in times of crisis. The communication features within the app also enable users to quickly and easily notify their loved ones about their safety, reducing anxiety and maintaining important connections during challenging times.

We aim to promote preparedness and resilience by providing educational resources, safety guidelines, and evacuation routes. It encourages users to create emergency plans and store essential documents securely within the app for quick access during an emergency.

Overall, this app combines hazard awareness, real-time updates, and communication features to empower users with the knowledge and tools they need to navigate natural disasters while providing peace of mind to their loved ones

### What we want our app to do:

**Data Collection and Analysis:** Gather comprehensive and up-to-date data on natural hazards, including historical records, scientific studies, and real-time monitoring. This data can help identify high-risk areas and understand the potential impacts of different disasters.

**Risk Assessment and Mapping:** Utilize the collected data to assess the vulnerability and exposure of communities to various natural hazards. Create hazard maps that visually illustrate the areas most at risk, taking into account factors such as proximity to fault lines, flood zones, or wildfire-prone regions.

**App Development:** Develop a user-friendly mobile application that integrates the risk assessment and mapping data. The app should provide interactive maps, detailed hazard information, and real-time updates from reliable sources, such as government agencies, weather services, and local authorities.

**Communication Features:** Incorporate communication features within the app to facilitate messaging and notifications. Users should be able to send pre-configured or custom messages to their designated contact lists, assuring them of their safety. Additionally, users should receive messages from their loved ones, creating a two-way communication channel.

**Preparedness and Education:** Include educational resources within the app to promote preparedness and resilience. Provide safety guidelines, evacuation routes, emergency plans, and storage options for essential documents. Offer tips on emergency supplies, shelter, and first aid, ensuring that users are well-informed and can take appropriate actions during a disaster.
