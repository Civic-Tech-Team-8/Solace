### Summary

Many people are unaware of the increase in natural disasters due to climate change and the specific hazards that their communities may face. Many do not have access to timely and accurate information about ongoing disasters and this can lead to a lack of preparedness and increased vulnerability to the effects of natural hazards. “Every year in the United States, natural hazards threaten lives and livelihoods and result in billions of dollars in damage.”(National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA))Knowledge about natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, and wildfires, helps people prepare and take appropriate actions to protect themselves, their families, and their property. Early warning systems, evacuation plans, and disaster preparedness measures can significantly reduce the loss of life and property during such events.

“Climate change is the defining issue of our time….every day we fail to act is a day that we step a little closer towards a fate that none of us wants- a fate that will resonate through generations in the damage done to humankind and life on earth.”(Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary General)

Additionally, during and after a disaster, people often experience anxiety and concern for the safety of their loved ones. “It's common for communities and individuals affected by a disaster to experience a range of thoughts, feelings and behaviours that can be intense, confusing and frightening.” (beyondblue.org) Communication channels can become disrupted or overloaded, making it difficult for individuals to reassure their family and friends that they are safe and secure.

The aftermath of a natural disaster leads to families being homeless, shortages of food and even a negative impact on the economy. This leaves the people impacted by the natural disasters vulnerable and in need of help with minimum support.

Solace provides users with a platform that enables them to navigate to a dedicated page showcasing various crisis events.
